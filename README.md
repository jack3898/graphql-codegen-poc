# POC

This was originally a POC for graphql codegen, but is just becoming a general POC of things.

## Scripts

- `npm run [script] -w [server|client]`

That's it.

## POC topics

- GraphQL Code generation to Apollo Client React query hooks
- ESLint and Prettier working together
- Eslint with Tailwind CSS
- ESLint root config without eslint config package
- Aliasing in Vite, importing root files without nasty relative paths (`../../../../` ðŸ¤¢)
  - It is Vite, but it should be possible with Webpack.
